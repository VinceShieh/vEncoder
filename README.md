vEncoder Project

This application can be served as a tool for video encoder performance analysis on Android devices.

It can query the supported video codec and color formats on target devices, read/generate yuv data and encode the date into video stream through HW path. It Supports different encoding rate (30/60/120fps) control, encoder parameters settings (FPS, bitrate, I frame interval, etc.), and arbitrary number of frame and total encoding time desired.

The package has been successfully tested on Nexus7/10 with KK running.
